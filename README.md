# Ridgeline Android downloads

## Base APK — optional imagery ZIP imports

[Download Ridgeline 3D 0.5.0 Base](Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-Base.apk)

This smaller installer includes the latest menu and bottom-panel changes, plus the small zoom 0–8 imagery set. Install it over the current Ridgeline 3D app. Existing routes and imported/downloaded data are retained.

To add the remaining overview imagery, download [all six prepared ZIPs](overview-packs/), then open **Layers → Download offline region → Included imagery → Import overview ZIPs** and select the ZIPs. Use these six prepared packs, rather than the fifteen original export ZIPs. Importing all six adds about 365 MB. Regional high-detail imagery and elevation downloads remain separate.

Open the APK file page and choose **Download raw file**. [Base APK checksum](Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-Base.apk.sha256).

## Latest: Ridgeline 3D 0.5.0 — full imagery included

**[Download Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-Full.apk — 391 MB](Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-Full.apk)**

Sign in to GitHub if required, open the APK file page and choose **Download raw file** (↓). The large installer is stored using Git LFS; GitHub's download serves the complete APK.

Install this single APK. **All supplied precomputed South Island/Rakiura overview imagery at tile zooms 0–12 is already inside it. No separate ZIP downloads or imports are needed.** The imagery is read directly from uncompressed APK assets; it is not copied out at first launch.

The APK uses the same signer as 0.4.0, so it installs as an update to Ridgeline 3D. Requires Android 8.0+ with up-to-date Android System WebView/Chrome. The original Direct 3D renderer, centred GPS SVG and Topo clarity changes are retained. Separate Cook-reference corrections remain excluded.

Detailed imagery beyond zoom 12 and elevation for offline 3D terrain/profiles still use user-selected region downloads. Current offline imagery limit: zoom 17. Online sources extend through zoom 19 where finer data exists. Image-tile zooms can differ from camera zooms.

[Validation details](Ridgeline-3D-VALIDATION.md) · [APK checksum](Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-Full.apk.sha256) · [Versioned validation record](Ridgeline-3D-0.5.0-validation.json)

This update adds **＋ Create new** below Import GPX in the logo menu, route/elevation and offline-region bottom panels with a 5/8-height map, coordinates under Advanced, and rectangle preview/cancellation improvements. Build, lint, 7 packaging tests and browser workflow checks passed. All six bundled pack hashes were verified inside this APK; the UI files match the synced build. The imagery and native reader retain the prior 0.4.0 verification. No emulator validation was requested or run. Phone runtime checks remain appropriate for this development preview.

## Website patch and earlier builds

The [website Topo patch](Ridgeline-Website-Topo-Fix-0.3.0.zip) still needs applying through the original Site deployment session; publishing the Android APK does not deploy that Site.

Earlier APKs and [the old six import ZIPs](overview-packs/) remain available for comparison or reproducing a build. Version 0.5.0 does not require those imports. The offline panel can remove old imported copies to reclaim duplicate storage while retaining bundled imagery.
